# Time Series Analysis of Stocks and Commodity Prices

The project aims to analyse the data from different time-series and study their properties and then try to give a reasonable forecast for the future.

Properties like stationarity, seasonality and trends in the data were discussed and techniques like ADF(Augmented Dickey Fuller Test) were employed to test the presence of the former and latter.

Various mathematical models like the MA, AR, ARMA and ARIMA were explored to check how they would fit to data in detail.

Influence and presence of stationarity, seasonality and trends was analysed in the above models and the concept of differencing was introduced.

After figuring out the order of the model that fits the data, various parameters of the model were calculated using computation, and forecasts were made by calculating the expected value of time-series at a time in the future by using the data we have.
